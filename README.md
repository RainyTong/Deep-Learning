- Perceptron:
  
  To implement and test a simple artificial neuron: a perceptron.
  - [perceptron.ipynb](https://github.com/RainyTong/Deep-Learning/blob/master/MLPandPerceptron/Part1%20Perceptron/perceptron.ipynb):

    
- Multiple Layer Perceptron:

  To implement a multi-layer perceptron using **numpy**.
  
  - [train_mlp_numpy_BGD.ipynb](https://github.com/RainyTong/Deep-Learning/blob/master/MLPandPerceptron/Part2%20MLP_Numpy/train_mlp_numpy_BGD.ipynb)
  - [train_mlp_numpy_SGD.ipynb](https://github.com/RainyTong/Deep-Learning/blob/master/MLPandPerceptron/Part2%20MLP_Numpy/train_mlp_numpy_SGD.ipynb)
  
  To implement a multi-layer perceptron using **Pytorch**.
  - [mlp_pytorch](https://github.com/RainyTong/Deep-Learning/tree/master/CNN_RNN/Part1%20MLP_PyTorch)
  
- CNN:

  To improve your neural architecture by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). You will use the CIFAR10 dataset but this time you will implement a CNN to classify the images in the dataset.
  
  - [cnn_train.ipynb](https://github.com/RainyTong/Deep-Learning/blob/master/CNN_RNN/Part2%20CNN/cnn_train.ipynb)
 
 - RNN:
  
    To implement a RNN to predict the last digit of a palindrome. Palindromes in general are strings that look the same when read forward and backward, e.g., 123454321, 1111, 4224, etc.
  
    - [rnn_train.ipynb](https://github.com/RainyTong/Deep-Learning/blob/master/CNN_RNN/Part3%20RNN/rnn_train.ipynb)
  
    To implement a LSTM-RNN to predict the last digit of a palindrome. 
  
    - [lstm_train.ipynb](https://github.com/RainyTong/Deep-Learning/blob/master/LSTM_GAN/Part1%20LSTM/lstm_train.ipynb)
  
- GAN:

  To implement a GAN (see slides for Lesson 9) that generates images similar to those of the training set.
  
  - [my_gan.ipynb](https://github.com/RainyTong/Deep-Learning/blob/master/LSTM_GAN/Part2%20GAN/my_gan.ipynb)
